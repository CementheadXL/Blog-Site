I didn’t take a traditional path. I spent years as a machine operator before deciding to pursue something more—something that aligned with my curiosity about people, systems, and impact. In my 30s, I went back to school and earned my associates degree then a bachelor's degree and a master’s degree in Business Psychology.

That decision opened the door to a new world: data-driven philanthropy. Today, I work in nonprofit research and strategy, using AI and analytics to help organizations understand their donors, optimize their efforts, and raise funds more intelligently.

This blog is where I explore those ideas—how technology is changing philanthropy, what I’m learning along the way, and why none of us are ever really too late to start something new.
