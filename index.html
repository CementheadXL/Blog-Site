    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My journey from the factory floor to the nonprofit sector—with a few pivots along the way.</p>
  </header>
  <p>I’ve been working in the nonprofit world for seven years, and I fell in love with it immediately. But my path here wasn’t typical.</p>

  <p>After high school, I went straight into factory work as a machine operator. That changed after a back injury forced me to pivot. I spent a couple of years in sales, but deep down, I knew I was capable of more.</p>

  <p>At 37, I took a leap and went to college—first earning my associate’s degree, then my bachelor’s, and eventually my master’s in Business Psychology. So yes, you could say I bring a unique perspective to the work I do today.</p>

  <p>I’ve been fascinated by computers since I was 16, when I begged my mom for a computer and somehow got internet access thanks to a friend who knew a guy. (Yes, I’m that old.) But despite the winding path, I’ve never been behind.</p>

  <p>This blog is where I share what I’m learning—about technology, nonprofit innovation, data strategy, and the personal growth that happens when you decide to bet on yourself a little later in life.</p>

    <h3>AI for All Sizes in Nonprofits: How Prospect Researchers Can Lead the Way</h3>

    <p>Whether you're hosting a neighborhood ice cream social for 20 or orchestrating a gala with over 300 guests, the size of your nonprofit event doesn't limit the value of the data you can collect. As a prospect researcher, I’ve seen firsthand how even the smallest engagement can uncover powerful donor insights when supported by the right tools.</p>

    <h4>A Real-World Example: Ice Cream Social Insights</h4>
    <p>Back when I served as an AmeriCorps VISTA, I hosted a simple ice cream social—an event with no more than 20 people. We used a basic attendee sign-in sheet and sent out a post-event survey afterward. That modest step ended up making a major difference. We were able to show real engagement and gather feedback that directly supported new, sustainable funding. Because we captured the data and showed the impact, the event received funding again the following year. Small event, big result.</p>

    <h4>Why Event Data Matters</h4>
    <p>Every RSVP, name tag, attendee form, and survey response is a building block. Prospect researchers thrive when we have access to consistent, well-structured data from events. By tracking who shows up, and how often, we start to surface patterns that reveal hidden capacity, philanthropic interests, and paths to deeper engagement. Some think of only tracking quantitative data, but qualitative data can be as important. Follow up after an event and invite feedback—it encourages future involvement.</p>

    <h4>AI Helps, No Matter Your Size</h4>
    <p>AI is not just for big budgets or large development teams. With today’s tools, small to mid-sized nonprofits can use AI to analyze event data, tag attendee behavior in CRMs, and even predict which guests are likely to become major donors. It doesn’t replace our instincts or judgment. It sharpens them.</p>

    <h4>Start Here — Three Ways to Use AI Now</h4>

    <h3>Adapting to Change: Funding Strategies for the New Nonprofit Era</h3>

    <p>In today’s shifting philanthropic landscape, it’s clear that traditional funding sources—federal, state, and local—are no longer guaranteed. Many nonprofits are navigating the reality that previously reliable support is shrinking or disappearing altogether.</p>

    <p>While a new bill sitting on the President’s desk offers some temporary relief—avoiding new taxes on endowments and preserving key 501(c)(3) incentives—we can’t afford to wait for legislation to fix what’s changing at the ground level.</p>

    <p>Now is the time for nonprofits to stop focusing solely on the problem and start generating solutions.</p>

    <p><strong>And it starts with this question:</strong><br>
    How well do you know your current relationships—and what data are you using to uncover new ones?</p>

    <h4>Rethinking Revenue Streams</h4>
    <p>In a time of financial uncertainty, many organizations default to cutting costs or launching urgent appeals. But sustainable change begins by diversifying funding and leveraging what you already have—relationships, data, and mission alignment.</p>

    <p>Segmenting your data can help fundraisers focus on the right prospects at the right time.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs):</strong> Are you identifying and cultivating donors with DAF capacity?</li>
      <li><strong>Corporate Giving:</strong> Have you mapped your corporate partnerships?</li>
      <li><strong>Individual Foundations:</strong> Are there private foundations whose interests align?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These opportunities aren't new—but the way we find, evaluate, and prioritize them can be.</p>

    <h4>Where AI Can Help</h4>
    <p>AI can assist development professionals by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Surfacing undiscovered donor pools through pattern and affinity analysis</li>
      <li>Mapping relationships between your board and corporate leaders</li>
      <li>Segmenting data to focus on the right prospects at the right time</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>So, Where Do You Start?</h4>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are your current donors giving below capacity?</li>
      <li>Are you underleveraging your board’s connections?</li>
      <li>Are you spending time with prospects that will never convert?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI won’t replace relationships, but it can reveal blind spots and sharpen your strategy.</p>

    <p><em>Let’s stop reacting—and start adapting.</em></p>

    <h3>AI Effect on Culture</h3>
    <p>Lately, I’ve been joking that AI is my favorite coworker—but honestly, I kind of mean it.</p>

    <p>There’s something refreshing about collaborating with a tool that doesn’t push back, doesn’t interrupt, and never needs coffee. When I bring an idea to an AI like ChatGPT, it doesn’t argue. It just builds. It says, “Sure, let’s try that,” and offers five ways to make it better. Sometimes it gives me a spark I didn’t even know I needed.</p>

    <p>Now, I’m not saying I’d trade in my real coworkers (well… maybe on Mondays). But AI has quietly reshaped how I work—and it’s starting to shape how we all work together.</p>

    <h4>Collaboration Without Friction</h4>
    <p>We’ve always known that great collaboration comes from different perspectives. But let’s be honest: real-life brainstorming can sometimes feel like a tug-of-war. Who speaks first? Who disagrees? Whose idea wins?</p>

    <p>AI shifts that energy. It’s like having a teammate who’s always in “yes, and…” mode. It doesn’t care about credit. It doesn’t get tired. And it doesn’t stall progress because it’s worried about how something sounds.</p>

    <h4>The New Culture of Connection</h4>
    <p>And it’s not just how we think—it’s where we meet. Companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are building immersive platforms that let people collaborate across the globe like they’re in the same room.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google’s Project Starline (aka Beam)</strong> makes remote meetings feel lifelike and face-to-face.</li>
      <li><strong>Meta’s metaverse tools</strong> create virtual spaces for shared presence and spontaneous collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> now offers immersive 3D meetings to bring people together digitally but meaningfully.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Imagine slipping on a pair of glasses and suddenly you’re co-creating with someone in another country. It’s not screen-sharing—it’s being present.</p>

    <h4>What Happens to Work Culture?</h4>
    <p>I don’t think AI replaces the human touch. People still matter. Empathy still matters. We still need mentors, hallway jokes, and real conversations.</p>

    <p>But I do think AI takes some of the friction out of working together. It removes the fear of judgment. It shortens the distance between “I have an idea” and “Let’s build on it.” And in doing that, it shapes a quieter, more confident kind of culture—where people aren’t afraid to share, try, or rethink.</p>

    <h4>Final Thought</h4>
    <p>So yeah, AI is my favorite coworker. Not because it’s perfect, but because it helps me be braver in my work. And if that’s not good culture, I don’t know what is.</p>
